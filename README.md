# TimeSeriesAnalysis-on-Air-Passengers

The GitHub repository provides a detailed analysis of time series data using Python, focusing on the classic Air Passengers dataset. Through this project, we aim to gain insights into passenger traffic patterns over time and make future predictions. Leveraging time series analysis techniques, including decomposition, seasonality, and trend identification, the analysis uncovers underlying patterns and trends within the dataset. The repository includes comprehensive documentation of data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation metrics, and forecasting techniques. With clear explanations and visual representations, this project serves as a valuable resource for understanding time series analysis concepts and their application to real-world datasets, particularly in the domain of transportation and tourism.
